                    <h1>Program</h1>
                    <p>I am in my 3rd Year of Mechatronics Engineering & Society. As a student in Mechatronics, which takes courses from nearly every department, I believe I am uniquely positioned to understand the issues and concerns of all our students in Society and represent them accordingly.</p>

                    <h1>Experience</h1>
                    <p> Iâ€™m no stranger to the MES or student societies, as I have been a part of the Engineering & Society Student Association (ESSA) for the past 2 years, and over the past year have performed the role of Hatch Coordinator for the MES. Through my involvement I've developed a deep passion for the Engineering & Society program, and that's the #1 quality I hope to demonstrate as a representative.</p>

                    <h1>Interests</h1>
                    <p>Outside of engineering I'm very interested in cognitive psychology and how we work as human beings. Personally, I have a strong interest in Nintendo and PC gaming, and anything fantasy or sci-fi. Oh, also I do dabble in the occasional meme. Please ask me what inspired me to become an engineer, you won't be disappointed.</p>
