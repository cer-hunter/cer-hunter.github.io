                <h1>Emphasizing Sustainability</h1>
                <p>Sustainability is one of the core pillars of the Society program and is something that a large majority of our student body actively care about. I think it would be remiss of me not to include an emphasis on sustainability as part of my platform.</p>
                <p>So how do I go about emphasizing sustainability? One of my major goals is to sit on the Sustainability committee in order to actively work towards expanding its scope and increasing its impact on the MES as a whole. Beyond that emphasizing sustainable practices wherever applicable will always be my priority.</p>

                <h1>Using Inquiry as a Tool</h1>
                <p>Inquiry is a fundamental skill that spans the Society curriculum, and I strongly believe that the use of this skill would be extremely valuable during MES council meetings, and when implementing policy in general.</p>
                <p>When creating policy that affects the entire engineering student body, I firmly believe it is vital to be able to formulate and ask the right questions to help develop more effective and sustainable solutions. Furthermore, as the Engineering & Society Representative, I feel that I would have an obligation to begin those conversations and move the entire MES towards an environment where critical thinking plays a major role in informing policy.</p>

                <h1>Society-ception</h1>
                <p>As the Engineering & Society Rep I want to embody the Engineering & Society student on the MES council. The only way to truly do that effectively, is to be as open as possible to any questions or concerns every student in Society has. That means making myself known to our student body throughout the various cohort group chats that are established and ensuring that any crucial MES information is properly communicated to and then advertised by the Engineering & Society Student Association (ESSA).</p>
                <p>It also means making sure every opinion is considered. Do you think one of our courses can be improved? Let’s talk about it and make a plan. We want a Society Minecraft Server? I’ll look into it. We need to emphasize that there is in fact an ampersand in Engineering & Society? I’m already on it.</p>
